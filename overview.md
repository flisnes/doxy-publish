# Dummy Code verview

I've included some dummy C-code and markdown files to demonstrate a minimal setup for generating Doxygen documentation.

The repository contains:
- **C Source Files:**  
  - `dummy.c`: Contains the `main()` function, an `add()` function, and an embedded Graphviz dot graph.
  - `utils.c`: Contains a helper function `multiply()` declared in `utils.h`.
- **Markdown Documentation:**  
  - `overview.md`: Provides an overview of the project.
  - `usage.md`: Contains instructions on how to compile and run the project.

Doxygen will parse both the source code and Markdown files to generate documentation.
